## Concept

The BlurTest is a game where the player has to guess the title of a film and/or the name(s) of the director, main actors and year of release, all within a given time.
For this, the user will have the movie poster with an applied blur effect, which will fade as time passes. The player must enter a maximum information in 45 seconds,
before the poster of the film becomes completely visible.

This BlurTest is brought to you by the Hufflepuff team, made of Chloé ELLE, Kylian GRONNIER, Sébastien BIROLLEAU, Vincent DAVIAUD and Pierre LACOSTE
